# @jitl/quickjs-browser-release-sync-wasm

ESModule for browsers or browser-like environments

This generated package is part of [quickjs-emscripten](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten).
It contains a variant of the quickjs WASM library, and can be used with quickjs-emscripten-core.

```typescript
import variant from "@jitl/quickjs-browser-release-sync-wasm"
import { newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant } from "quickjs-emscripten-core"
const QuickJS = await newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant(variant)
```

This variant was built with the following settings:

## Library: quickjs

The original [bellard/quickjs](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs) library.

## Release mode: release

Optimized for performance; use when building/deploying your application.

## Module system: esm

This variant exports an ESModule, which is standardized for browsers and more modern browser-like environments. It cannot be imported from CommonJS without shenanigans.

## Extra async magic? No

The default, normal build. Note that both variants support regular async functions.

## Single-file, or separate .wasm file? wasm

Has a separate .wasm file. May offer better caching in your browser, and reduces the size of your JS bundle. If you have issues, try a 'singlefile' variant.
