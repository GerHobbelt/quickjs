# @jitl/quickjs-browser-debug-sync-singlefile

ESModule for browsers or browser-like environments

This generated package is part of [quickjs-emscripten](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten).
It contains a variant of the quickjs WASM library built with the following configuration:

## Library: quickjs

The original [bellard/quickjs](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs) library.

## Release mode: debug

Enables assertions and memory sanitizers. Try to run your tests against debug variants, in addition to your preferred production variant, to catch more bugs.

## Module system: esm

This variant exports an ESModule, which is standardized for browsers and more modern browser-like environments. It cannot be imported from CommonJS without shenanigans.

## Extra async magic? No

The default, normal build. Note that both variants support regular async functions.

## Single-file, or separate .wasm file? singlefile

The WASM runtime is included directly in the JS file. Use if you run into issues with missing .wasm files when building or deploying your app
