   *
   * - If the method returns any value other than one of the string values
   *   which are normally the result of using the `typeof` operator, the engine
   *   behaves as if no `Symbol.typeofValue` method was present on the object.
   * - If an error is thrown from this method, or an error is thrown while
   *   accessing this property, the error will be silently ignored, and the
   *   engine will behave as if no `Symbol.typeofValue` method was present on
   *   the object.
   * - If this property is present on an object, but the value of that property
   *   is not a function, the engine will not consider that value when
   *   determining the result of the `typeof` operation (it'll ignore it).
